# exercise: Loop over some type of files and use the 
# "grep" UNIX command to find snippets of strings in them.

# exercies solution:
# loop through sh files and find instances of the keyword "while"
for file in *.sh; do
    # use "grep" to search for the keyword "while" in each sh file
    # -H prints the name of the file and -n prints the line number where "while" is found
    grep -Hn "while" "$file"
